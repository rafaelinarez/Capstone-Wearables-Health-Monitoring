# Integrated Health Monitoring Using Wearable Devices

This project uses wearable device data to predict sleep quality based on activity levels, heart rate, and METs.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafaelinarez/Capstone-Wearables-Health-Monitoring.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Capstone-Wearables-Health-Monitoring
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
